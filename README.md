In this API tutorial project, weâ€™ll be following a mock Women's Advocacy Group (WAG) as they:


1. append data to their existing lists with **Smartmatch**,

2. compare demographic counts of their data with the national voter file with **Listbuilder**, and

3. upload their list to Facebook for digital advertising with **Onboarding**.
