## Introduction
In this API tutorial project, we'll be following a mock Women's Advocacy Group (WAG) as they:

1. append data to their existing lists with [**SmartMatch**](https://docs.targetsmart.com/developers/tsapis/v2/service/smartmatch.html),
2. compare demographic counts of their data with the national voter file with [**ListBuilder**](https://docs.targetsmart.com/developers/tsapis/v2/person/listbuilder.html), and
3. upload their list to Facebook for digital advertising with [**Onboarding**](https://docs.targetsmart.com/developers/tsapis/v2/service/onboarding.html).
